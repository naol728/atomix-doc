# Installation

Atomix is split into two packages:

- **`atomix-core`** – the core state management engine (framework-agnostic)
- **`atomix-react`** – optional bindings for seamless React integration

---

## 📦 Install with npm

```bash
npm install atomix-core atomix-react
```

## 📦 Install with yarn

```bash
yarn install atomix-core atomix-react
```

## 🔍 Package Overview

| Package        | Description                                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `atomix-core`  | Core atom and state engine. Works anywhere.     |
